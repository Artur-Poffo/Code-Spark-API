## About

CodeSpark API - CodeSpark API is an API that follows good practices such as: DDD and clean architecture, it is an API responsible for a course platform, it contains a file upload system for Cloudflare R2 (it uses AWS S3 under the hood) and a class evaluation system

It is a TCC project for the [Entra21 training program](https://www.entra21.com.br/) in Vue.js course

## Potential Refactoring or Updates

> The API scaled more than we thought and that's why some things were left out even of the MVP, but we intend to continue with the project after the presentation

- [x] Implement method for course repository.
- [x] Refactor dependencies in all unit tests.
- [x] Verify the usage of `Promise.all()` and apply destructuring where applicable.
- [x] Review use cases and explore potential improvements.
- [x] Ensure consistent usage of `new UniqueEntityId()` for entity IDs and rectify any inconsistencies.
- [x] Evaluate the Enrollment entity for possible simplifications in managing modules and classes.
- [x] Replace all asynchronous `forEach` loops with `Promise.all()` combined with asynchronous `map`.
- [x] Update error handling in use cases.
- [x] Implement sorting in `findMany` methods of Prisma repositories.
- [x] Refactor database relation names.
- [x] Revise mark as complete functionality for classes and modules system.
- [x] Fix infinite calls to Prisma repositories in some mapper usage scenarios.
- [x] Introduce domain events for Prisma repositories.
- [ ] Implement mappers for mapping domain entities to DTOs.
- [ ] Implement pagination.

## How it works

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and a REST client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

You will also need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed to run the
postgres database with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

**it is very important that before running the project you configure the environment variables as indicated in the file: .env.example**

#### Run the app

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Artur-Poffo/Code-Spark-API.git

# Access the project folder cmd/terminal
$ cd Code-Spark-API

# install the dependencies
$ yarn

# Inicialize the database
$ yarn docker:init
# This script should create and start a docker container with Postgres database

# Then when you want to stop running docker, run:
$ yarn docker:stop
# Or just press Ctrl+c

# When you want start the container again, run
$ yarn docker:start

# Remember to create the RSA keys for the JWT, instructions in the .env.example file

# Run the application in development mode
$ yarn start:dev

# The server will start at port: 3333 - You can now test in Insomnia or another REST client: http://localhost:3333
```

#### Run tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
$ yarn test:unit

# Run unit tests in watch mode
$ pnpm test:unit:watch

# Run test coverage
$ yarn test:cov
```
