## About

CodeSpark API - The CodeSpark API adheres to industry best practices such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and clean architecture. It serves as the backbone for a course platform, featuring a file upload system integrated with Cloudflare R2 (powered by AWS S3) and a comprehensive class evaluation system.

This project serves as the TCC (Trabalho de Conclus√£o de Curso - Course Conclusion Work) for the [Entra21 training program](https://www.entra21.com.br/) Vue.js course.

## Potential Refactoring or Updates

> The API's scope has expanded beyond our initial expectations, necessitating some features to be deferred even from the MVP. Nevertheless, we're committed to further development post-presentation.

- [x] Implement a method for the course repository.
- [x] Refactor dependencies in all unit tests.
- [x] Optimize the usage of `Promise.all()` and apply destructuring where applicable.
- [x] Review use cases and explore potential improvements.
- [x] Ensure consistent usage of `new UniqueEntityId()` for entity IDs and rectify any inconsistencies.
- [x] Evaluate the Enrollment entity for possible simplifications in managing modules and classes.
- [x] Replace all asynchronous `forEach` loops with `Promise.all()` combined with asynchronous `map`.
- [x] Update error handling in use cases.
- [x] Implement sorting in `findMany` methods of Prisma repositories.
- [x] Refactor database relation names.
- [x] Revise mark as complete functionality for classes and modules system.
- [x] Fix infinite calls to Prisma repositories in some mapper usage scenarios.
- [x] Introduce domain events for Prisma repositories.
- [ ] Implement mappers for mapping domain entities to DTOs.
- [ ] Implement pagination.
- [ ] Implement End-to-End (E2E) tests.
- [ ] Refactor error handling in controllers.

## How It Works

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), an editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and a REST client such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

Additionally, Docker is required to run the PostgreSQL database using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

**Before running the project, make sure to configure the environment variables as indicated in the `.env.example` file.**

#### Running the App

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Artur-Poffo/Code-Spark-API.git

# Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
$ cd Code-Spark-API

# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Initialize the database
$ yarn docker:init
# This script should create and start a Docker container with the PostgreSQL database

# To stop Docker, run:
$ yarn docker:stop
# Or press Ctrl+C

# To start the container again, run:
$ yarn docker:start

# Generate RSA keys for JWT authentication, as instructed in the .env.example file

# Run the application in development mode
$ yarn start:dev

# The server will start at port 3333. You can now test it using Insomnia or any other REST client: http://localhost:3333
```

#### Run tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
$ yarn test:unit

# Run unit tests in watch mode
$ yarn test:unit:watch

# Run test coverage
$ yarn test:cov
```
